# Project

```{r}

# Read in data
hourly_data = read.csv("P3S2_hourly_clean.csv")
respondent_IDs = read.csv("Respondent IDs.csv")

# Filter data for one respondent ID
data = hourly_data %>% filter(respondent_id == 101)

# Remove hour25
data = hourly_data[-32]
ts_data = ts(data, start = 2006, frequency = 365)

# RULES
# test data 20% of training
# The test set should ideally be at least as large as the maximum forecast horizon required.

# USEFUL FUNCTIONS
# window() -> extraxcts data from a timepoint onwards
# subsetting() -> extracts a subset of a time sries
# ts() -> turns into time series data
# autoplot() -> plots time series data
# ggAcf -> autocorrelation

```
